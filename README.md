## Methodology

#### Step8: Language detection by using Tikaâ€™s language identifier and Google LangDetect/Python
Since the narrative part of the post has a lot of tags, we wrote the remove_tag function to remove tags from the text. Then we called tika.language.from_buffer and langdetect.detect to detect the language of the text, and store the detection results into 'tika_language' and 'google_language'columns.

``` 
tika.language.from_buffer
langdetect.detect
``` 

#### Step9: RTG Translation
First, we use the results of Step8 to put the non-English post index into the Trans_list. Then remove tags and urls from the post with remove_tag and find_regular (because of the possibility of a timeout error). Then we use docker tp create RTG localhost and translate the text using tika.translate.auto_from_buffer(txt,'en').

It is easy to generate a timeout error while translating because the text is too long or in certain languages (such as Hindi and Mali). For text longer than 120, we cut it into multiple texts according to punctuation marks, then translated thoses pieces and integrated. The result is stored in 'rtg_translate' column.

``` 
tika.translate.auto_from_buffer
```
